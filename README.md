# Horse Builder for Crowd
This HDA allows you to easily create horses for Crowd simulations.

- Download the `.hda` file and put it in your `otls` directory (on Windows, that's usually `\Documents\houdinixx.x\otls`).
- Launch Houdini and the HDA should appear in the TAB Menu under the name `Horse Builder for Crowd` (only in the SOP context).
